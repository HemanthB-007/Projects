# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using AI

## Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to detect and classify network threats using **machine learning models**. The system analyzes network traffic patterns and identifies suspicious activities in real-time.

## Features
- **Machine Learning-based Threat Detection**
- **Real-time Network Traffic Monitoring**
- **Anomaly and Signature-based Detection**
- **Logging and Alert System**
- **Scalable and Customizable**

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Network Traffic Datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS)
- Packet Analysis (Wireshark, Tshark, Scapy)
- Flask (for API integration)

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/IDS-AI.git
cd IDS-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing Deep Learning for advanced threat detection
- Integrating with SIEM systems
- Real-time visualization dashboard

# Vulnerability Scanner using Python

## Overview
This **Python-based Vulnerability Scanner** scans web applications and networks for security flaws, identifying weaknesses such as **open ports, misconfigurations, outdated software, and SQL Injection vulnerabilities**.

## Features
- **Port Scanning (Nmap integration)**
- **Web Application Security Scanning (SQLi, XSS, etc.)**
- **Banner Grabbing for Fingerprinting**
- **Customizable Scanning Modules**

## Technologies Used
- Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scapy, Nmap)
- OWASP Security Standards
- Flask (for Web Interface)

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Vulnerability-Scanner.git
cd Vulnerability-Scanner

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python scanner.py --target https://example.com
```

## Future Enhancements
- Automating CVE detection
- AI-based vulnerability assessment
- Reporting and remediation suggestions
